# Machine-Learning
Contains diverse course projects


iML_w series:
selected weekly course projects from the course 22HS ML Machine Learning - an Interdisciplinary Introduction

iML_w11:
designed a machine learning/deep learning algorithm to help determine/predict whether a patient is non-diabetic (int 0) or diabetic (int 1)

iML_w12:
forecast time series data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

iML_w09:
studied the toxicity of molecules, which are described using the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES). The system allows to describe the structure of chemical species in the form of a line notation, making it suited for a machine learning approach

iML_w08:
trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on court proceeding texts from the European Court of Human Rights and learns whether there has been a violation against a specific article of the European Convention on Human Rights or not

Eyetracking series:

ET_3.py:
used two algorithms to determine fixation period from eye-tracking data (in 60Hz and 2000Hz) and plotted the graphs.
