# Contents

### 1. NeuroAI project - analyzing iEEG using LLM
NeuroAI_5_train:
Last code, passing data to GPT2 with hugging face API. 
(Requires update on parameters like 8bit optimizer, but the basic structure is there.)

### 2. EEG analysis - analyzing EEG using basic signal processing packages in python and matlab
BG_1_PreprocessAnalysis:
preprocess and analyze individual cognitive load using wavebands (Delta band, Alpha band, etc.)

CL_1_Preprocess:
preprocess EEG data for each participants

CL_3_TFR:
analyze individual musical sensitivity and emotions according to cluster and wavebands

CL_4_Plot:
align neural data with musical data for report in LaTeX.

### 3. Machine Learning - an Interdisciplinary Introduction ###

iML_w12:
forecast time series data using LSTM RNN

iML_w11:
designed a ML/DL algorithm to help determine/predict whether a patient is non-diabetic (int 0) or diabetic (int 1)

iML_w09:
studied the toxicity of molecules, which are described using the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES). The system allows to describe the structure of chemical species in the form of a line notation, making it suited for a machine learning approach

iML_w08:
trained an SVM model on court proceeding texts from the European Court of Human Rights and learns whether there has been a violation against a specific article of the European Convention on Human Rights or not

### 4. Eye-tracking(In the '*Eye-tracking*' folder) ###

ET_5.ipynb:
implemented an SVM model to classify the gender of a reader based on eye-tracking data. Eye-tracking data taken from the Potsdam Textbook Corpus (https://osf.io/dn5hp/files)

ET_3.py:
used two algorithms to determine fixation period from eye-tracking data (in 60Hz and 2000Hz) and plotted the graphs.
- 2000Hz_Trial16_velocity_5.0_pxms_200ms).png:
- the result file from ET_3.py using velocity algorithm
- 2000Hz_Trial13_dispersion_20.0px_200ms).png:
- the result file from ET_3.py using dispersion algorithm

### 5. Foundations of Data Science ###

FDS_3_CIFAR-10.ipynb:
used transfer learning to build a convolutional neural network to tackle the CIFAR-10 dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

FDS_3_MNIST.ipynb:
built a CNN to classify the handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

FDS_2.ipynb:
comparing the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Logistic Regression on several datasets. reproduced some of the experimental results in the paper: *On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes*, by Andrew Y. Ng and Michael I. Jordan.

FDS_1.ipynb:
implemented and trained a linear regression model using the least squares method on the winequality dataset using the NumPy library. Learning curves will be plotted to determine if the model is overfitting or underfitting.
applied the basis expansion to the dataset and trained linear regression models with regularization, i.e., Ridge and Lasso., using the functions from the scikit-learn library.
